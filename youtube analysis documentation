YouTube Trending Video Analytics Documentation
1. Introduction
YouTube is one of the largest video-sharing platforms globally, and its trending videos reflect dynamic user interests and content popularity. Analyzing YouTube trending videos across different countries helps uncover patterns in content genres, audience sentiment, and regional preferences. This documentation outlines the process of analyzing YouTube trending video datasets from multiple countries, performing sentiment analysis on video titles and tags, ranking video categories by average views using SQL, and visualizing trends over time.

2. Data Collection and Preparation
Datasets Used:
•	Trending YouTube Video Statistics dataset covering 113 countries from Kaggle.
•	Additional YouTube comments datasets for sentiment analysis.
Data Cleaning and Standardization:
•	Merge datasets from different countries ensuring consistent column names and data types.
•	Handle missing or erroneous data such as null values in views, likes, or publish dates.
•	Convert date-time fields to standard formats for time-series analysis.
Key Columns:
•	title, channel_title, category_id, publish_time, tags
•	Engagement metrics: views, likes, dislikes, comment_count
•	Trending date and time difference between publish and trending date (time_diff)

3. Sentiment Analysis on Titles and Tags
Objective:
Analyze the sentiment polarity of video titles and tags to understand emotional tone and its correlation with video popularity.
Methodology:
•	Preprocess text data: remove emojis, special characters, convert to lowercase, remove stop words.
•	Use Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and logistic regression models for sentiment classification.
•	Assign polarity scores: positive (1), negative (-1), neutral (0).
•	Aggregate sentiment scores by category and region to identify sentiment trends.
Tools:
•	Python libraries: , TextBlok, or custom logistic regression models.
•	Visualization of sentiment distribution using Seaborn (e.g., bar plots, heatmaps).

4. SQL Analytics: Ranking Categories by Average Views
Database Setup:
•	Load cleaned dataset into a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Sample Queries:
•	Rank video categories by average views to identify most popular genres globally and regionally:
sql
SELECT category_id, AVG(views) AS avg_views
FROM trending_videos
GROUP BY category_id
ORDER BY avg_views DESC;
•	Calculate average time for videos to become trending:
sql
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(trending_date, DATE(publish_time))) AS avg_days_to_trend
FROM trending_videos;
•	Filter by region or time period to compare trends across countries.
Insights:
•	Identify categories with highest engagement (e.g., Music, Entertainment).
•	Understand temporal patterns in trending durations.

5. Time-Series Visualizations for Trending Duration
Objective:
Visualize how long videos stay trending and how trending patterns vary over time and regions.
Approach:
•	Use Python’s Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot:
•	Distribution of trending durations (time_diff).
•	Number of trending videos over time by category and region.
•	Sentiment trends over time.
Example Visualizations:
•	Line charts showing average trending duration per category.
•	Heatmaps comparing sentiment scores across regions.
•	Bar charts of top trending genres by country.

6. Dashboard and Region-wise Comparison
Dashboard Components:
•	Interactive charts showing:
•	Most popular genres by average views and sentiment.
•	Sentiment distribution of video titles and tags.
•	Regional comparisons of trending video metrics (views, likes, comments).
•	Time-series of trending durations.
Tools for Dashboard:
•	Python libraries: Plotly Dash .
•	SQL backend for real-time queries.

7. Final Report and Data Storytelling
Summary of Findings:
•	Music and entertainment videos dominate trending lists globally, with regional variations.
•	Positive sentiment in titles correlates with higher engagement and trending likelihood..
•	Average time for videos to trend is approximately 3.9 days, varying by publish time and region.
•	Regional preferences and sentiment patterns reveal cultural differences in content consumption.
Recommendations:
•	Content creators should optimize video titles and tags for positive sentiment to increase trending chances.
•	Advertisers can target high-engagement categories identified through SQL ranking.
•	Further research could integrate comment sentiment and viewer demographics for deeper insights.

8. Appendix: Sample Python and SQL Code Snippets
Python (Sentiment Analysis Example):
python
import pandas as pd
from textblob import TextBlob

def get_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return 'positive'
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return 'neutral'
    else:
        return 'negative'

df['title_sentiment'] = df['title'].apply(get_sentiment)
SQL (Ranking Categories):
sql
SELECT category_id, AVG(views) AS avg_views
FROM trending_videos
GROUP BY category_id
ORDER BY avg_views DESC;
